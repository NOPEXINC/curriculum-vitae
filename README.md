Experience
----------

### Head of Technology, J. Walter Thompson, London, England

September 2013 - Present

#### Overview

Joined the JWT London as Head of Front End development and co-department manager. After 7 months I was promoted to Head of Technology. The Head of Technology is an operational role that oversees all technical aspects of digital project delivery for JWT London. 

#### Department operations

As well as being a client facing role, it involved many department operations such as staff management, writing key project documentation (Eg Functional &amp; Technical specifications), project technical recommendations, project resource allocation, project cost estimation, third party supplier liaison, client account &amp; technical liaison, project brainstorming with creatives etc.

As well as handling department operations I introduced new processes such as: automated asset building &amp; optimization for all projects, modern techniques for building internationalised interfaces, tooling creation as a project phase in order to validate development and Q&A, modern version control and continuous integration techniques.

#### Management

Managed a team that consisted of full stack, front end, back end, technical consultants and system administrators. This involved internal department operations such as daily stand ups, project code reviews, regular employee performance reviews/HR liaison, staff hiring etc.

External to the department, I provided regular operational updates to senior JWT management as well as clients.

#### A selection of projects delivered during my time at JWT London:

-   **94 country EMEA campaign &amp; product launch site for Canon**

    The site serves as the campaign center for Canon's planned 3 year 'Come and See' campaign. The site also served as the launch platform for 8 new products, a video resource for photographers as well as a place to learn more about the incredible video footage found in the ATL campaign. The site is fully internationalised for EMEA by being built for 94 different regional cultures (includes 19 languages) at launch. The launch itself involved a fully integrated process that involved web, social, experiential, print and TV.

-   **Mobile first, Arabic and China Firewall detection for Falcon and Associates**
    
    Delivered a multi lingual, mobile responsive site for Falcon and Associates as technical lead. The site can switch between English, Chinese and Arabic - a RTL language. These features were coupled with an innovative Dubai skyline panorama feature, a clean design, an automated asset optimisation and build pipeline process as well as a custom China Firewall detection technique that swaps embedded Vimeo videos for alternates that are viewable in China.

-   **Digital presence embodies the brand for KitKat**
    
    Delivered an excellent follow up to the very successful KitKat Android campaign. The new KitKat global website involved turning the website itself into a break for mobile visitors by incorporating a JS canvas ball maze game - with multiple levels and scores to share - into the website itself. Additionally the site served as a centre for all brand social activity across multiple countries. As the client was price conscious, a small team brainstormed ideas and delivered a working minimum viable product to the client within 72 hours. The client loved it and approved additional development and public release.

-   **JWT London became a CDA for Bayer**

    Personally attended and successfully completed the Bayer Certified Development program (graduating first in the class), making JWT London the only Certified Development Agency (CDA) in the JWT network for Bayer worldwide. The combining of this technical knowledge along with JWT London's strategic partnership with Bayer Consumer Care allowed JWT to more accurately plan and pitch digital work to Bayer, as well as ensure a higher quality of final delivery.

#### Clients

HSBC, Bayer, Canon, Microsoft, Nestle, Unilever, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Kimberley Clarke, Falcon &amp; Associates.

Open Source &amp; Side Projects
---------------------------

I consider personal development a very important part of my web career and that mainly manifests itself in me having various side projects that I work on in my own time in order to learn or gain experience with new technologies. Many times my side projects are collaborative efforts with developers around the globe and some times they become commercial ventures.

Some examples:

-   [Entry Analytics](http://devot-ee.com/add-ons/entry-analytics)
    
    Commercial add-on for ExpressionEngine that parses Google Analytics data in order to display content performance and allows authors to determine the value of an article (not a URL) when viewed as part of a whole site.

-   [Site Manager](https://github.com/ckimrie/Site-Manager)
    
    Open Source add-on for migrating ExpressionEngine channels, fields &amp; categories between development, preview and production server environments

-   [EE Debug Toolbar](https://github.com/mithra62/ee_debug_toolbar)

    Open Source add-on for debugging ExpressionEngine template &amp; database performance during a site build. Features a full API that allows third party developers to integrate and show their own debugging data.
    
-   [CKSlider](https://github.com/ckimrie/ckslider)

    General purpose content carousel/slider engine. Developed &amp; open sourced while working at Moresoda. Core requirements were to have a familiar, extensible and battle tested carousel that supported IE7+ and used Deferreds throughout its API.
    
-   [ExpressionEngine Data API](https://github.com/ckimrie/ee-data-api)

    Drop in channel and entry data REST API for ExpressionEngine. Allows programmatic access to all entry data in JSON or XML formats.

    Some small hacks with Canvas and JS. All are short UI experiments coded in a single sitting over the course of a couple of hours based on a simple idea.
